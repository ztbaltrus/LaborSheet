// This file contains an empty module that does nothing.
// It's meant to be added as an entry point to the main bundle
// and helps reliably adding some Aurelia dependencies that are attached 
// to no module in particular, such as `includeAll` results or `aureliaApp`.
//
// Trying to attach those dependencies to, for example, 'aurelia-bootstrapper' 
// is unreliable if 'aurelia-bootstrapper' is in a DLL outside the bundle.
//
// Trying to attach to 'aurelia-loader-webpack' works well, unless a user
// configures a customized loader instead (unlikely, but in theory supported).
