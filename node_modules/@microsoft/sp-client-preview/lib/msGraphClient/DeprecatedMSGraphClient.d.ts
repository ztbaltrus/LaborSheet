/**
 * MSGraphClient is used to perform REST calls against Microsoft Graph.
 *
 * @remarks The Microsoft Graph JavaScript client library is a lightweight wrapper around the
 * Microsoft Graph API. This class allows developers to start making REST calls to MSGraph without
 * needing to initialize the the MSGraph client library. If a custom configuration is desired,
 * the MSGraphClient api function needs to be provided with that custom configuration for
 * every request.
 *
 * Find out more about the MSGraphSDK here:
 * https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript
 * @beta
 * @deprecated Please use the MSGraphClient from the MSGraphClientFactory.
